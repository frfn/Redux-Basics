How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.

MY TAKE:

prereq: npm install --save react-redux 
        npm install --save redux

1. create store folder
    - create reducer folder + files for reducer
    - actions.js [if needed]

2. create reducer file
    - look at the steps

3. create actions.js CONSTANTS
    - i did export default ... it should be 'export const ADD = "ADD";'

4. Persons.js -- adding the Redux properties!
    - connect
    - mapStateToProps
    - mapDispatchToProps

5. TypeError: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_react___default.a.createContext is not a function
    - npm update react react-dom

6. Input Forms , no need for redux
6a. Added my own twist to it, passing in the event from AddPerson form TO personReducer.js

7. Just finished Redux basics!!
